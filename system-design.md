### Frontend System design

System design is the process of ideating and designing a scalable system adhering to a problem statement.
System design consists of two parts -> HLD and LLD

#### HLD
HLD or high-level design involves defining:
- Requirements: functional and non-functional
- Scoping and prioritizing the functional and non-functional requirements that will be touch-based.
- Tech choices to accomplish the design successfully

#### LLD
LLD or low-level design involves:
- Component architecture
- Protocols, schemas, and implementation details


### HLD
- Requirements: Functional
  - Essentially building blocks of the application
  - Mandatory features that shape the product

- Requirements: Non-functional
  - Generic features that enhance the UX, although it is termed as non-functional, it is important to implement the non-functional requirements as well.
  - Accessibility
  - Availability
  - Asset Optimization
  - Web Vitals
  - Consistency
  - Localisation
  - Performance
  - Logging & Monitoring
  - Security
 

#### Performance (Network optimization)
- Lazy loading
- Using `async` & `defer` in script tags to avoid render blocking
- Intersection Observer (content-visibility)
- Resource hinting (dns-prefetch, preconnect(dns-prefetch+TCP handshake), prefetch, prerender)
- Rendering (Parsing -> Creating DOM & CSSOM -> Create render tree -> Create layout tree -> Create paint tree -> Draw pixels(Compositing))

#### Performance (Asset optimization)
- Using `picture`'s `srcset`



## Security
### JWT
- Earlier, upon authentication, a session ID would be generated for an authenticated user, stored on the server, and sent to the user as a cookie. On corresponding requests for authorization, the server looks up a user with the session ID and then responds, essentially storing the session ID on the server.
- A JSWT on the other hand is a token generated by the server on successful authentication, generates a token based on a private key, and sends this token to the client without storing it on the server. Upon corresponding requests, the server verifies the token signature and responds accordingly. A JWT token consists of 3 parts separated by `.` the first part encodes the algorithm used for encryption, the second part represents the payload, and the third part is the signature part created by clubbing the encoded header and payload string and encrypted using a private key.

### XSS (Cross-site scripting)
